conv-net-version-3.0
===================

Newly implemented convnet
You should have a cifar-10 dataset in your folder.

3-channels images supported.
Add Dropout;
In conv layers, one can use either 3-channel conv kernels or single-chanel conv kernels (that is to say, whether share weights).
Local Response Normalization supported (still buggy).

This is an EARLY ADOPTERS EDITION, which is still buggy, I'll post formal version in days.
